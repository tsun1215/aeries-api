aeries-api
==========
Initial prototype by David Harrison, current notes:
- Not in an api format, currently using data from stdin and printing data to stdout
- grades.py and assignments.py share a similar design, and with some work, could be combined, however, there are some significant differences that might make this difficult
- fromTo() in locallib.py may be better replaced by an existing library function
